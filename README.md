# ENGG2112 ‚Äì Sleep Quality Detector

This project predicts a person's sleep quality (good or bad) based on their daily lifestyle data such as step count, heart rate, caffeine intake, and screen time.

### Stuff for the report (Temporarily in readme)
#### Things to mention in report
- small dataset
- mention data leakage and overfitting
- Methods ‚Äì Logistic Regression Model
  - " Logistic Regression was implemented using scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, class_weight = ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù) following the probabilistic framework described in Week 5 lectures.
The model assumes a linear relationship between input features and the log-odds of achieving good sleep quality.
Training used 5-fold Stratified Cross-Validation to reduce sampling bias.
Continuous variables were scaled and categorical features one-hot encoded through the pre-processing pipeline (preprocessor.joblib).
Model parameters (coefficients Œ≤) were estimated via maximum-likelihood, optimised using the LBFGS solver until convergence (max_iter = 1000).
Evaluation metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, in accordance with Week 2 guidelines on classification performance. "
- Findings ‚Äì Logistic Regression and Trade-off Analysis
  - "Logistic Regression achieved the best overall performance among baseline classifiers, with mean cross-validation accuracy ‚âà 0.993 and ROC-AUC ‚âà 0.999.
The most influential predictors were sleep duration (+2.20) and stress level (‚Äì1.97), confirming that longer rest and lower stress are strong indicators of high sleep quality.
Occupational categories such as Salesperson (‚Äì1.28) and Nurse (‚Äì0.50) were negatively correlated with good sleep, while Accountant (+1.08) and Lawyer (+0.58) showed positive effects, suggesting lifestyle regularity impacts outcomes.
The ROC curve indicated near-perfect separability of the two classes at a default threshold (0.5).
Given the project‚Äôs recall-priority objective (avoiding false ‚Äúgood‚Äù predictions), subsequent threshold sweeps will confirm the optimal operating point (likely ‚âà 0.45).
Overall, the model meets and exceeds the acceptance target (AUC ‚â• 0.75, F1 ‚â• 0.70) defined in the proposal."
- Cross-validation and shuffle-split results show minimal variance (AUC ‚âà 0.998 ¬± 0.0035), with the learning curve demonstrating convergence between training and validation F1 scores. These patterns indicate that the logistic regression model generalises well and is not overfitting to the small dataset. Nevertheless, given the limited sample size (n ‚âà 374), external validation on unseen data is recommended before deployment.
- Discussion ‚Äì Reflection
  - The exceptionally high metrics imply potential overfitting or feature redundancy due to small sample size (~374 records).
Future iterations will test regularisation strength (C parameter) and repeat validation with the winsorised and drop-outlier datasets to verify robustness.
